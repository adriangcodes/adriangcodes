# 👋 Hi, I’m Adrian

I'm a full-stack web developer with a builder’s mindset and 13+ years of experience turning complex problems into clean, scalable solutions across development, strategy, marketing, and operations.

I’ve built everything from a peer-to-peer Bitcoin lending platform to a sustainability materiality assessment tool—always with a focus on thoughtful design, real-world outcomes, and writing clean, human-centred code.

Before transitioning into tech, I worked across the creative industries, consulting, and agency world—leading high-trust teams, managing $1M+ accounts, and helping startups scale. That background helps me bridge the gap between product, code, and business impact.
